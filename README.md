# Closest-Pair-Problem-SinglyLL
Implementation and time complexity analysis of the Closest Pair Problem using recursion. This time however we manually implement our own Singly Linked List. We find the closest pair of points by recursively dividing in subsets with half the size the set of coordinates and applying the Brute Force Algorithm when there are only 3 or less points in the subset. Must take into account the possibility of the closest pair being from 2 different subsets. This means creating a list of candidates by comparing the points in the borders of different subsets between them and applying Brute Force in the candidates. The original set of coordinates must be created with n points of random coordinates. This must be done with a manually implemented Linked List and analyze the time complexity relative to solving the same task using an ArrayList. The program finds the minimum distance 200 times for every set of coordinates of size n, where n varies from 100 to 50000 incrementing by a factor of 4/3. This is done in order to analyze the time complexity of the algorithm.
